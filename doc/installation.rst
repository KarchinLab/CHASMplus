Releases
~~~~~~~~

20/20+ can be downloaded on `github <https://github.com/KarchinLab/2020plus/releases>`_.

Package requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Upgrading the package dependency of probabilistic2020 to version >=1.0.6 is recommended.

Once downloaded, please add the directory to your :code:`PATH` variable.
Because 20/20+ internally uses the random forest package in R, you will both need `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_ and the randomForest library installed. Once R is installed, you can install the random forest package:

.. code-block:: R

    > install.packages("randomForest")

If you do not have permission to install `randomForest` on the system wide R, you can install in your local user directory by creating an `~/.Renviron` file as the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    R_LIBS=~/Rlibs

Where, in this case, the R libraries will be installed in the `~/Rlibs` directory.

20/20+ also requires the following python packages:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas>=0.17
* scikit-learn
* rpy2
* probabilistic2020
* matplotlib (optional)

To install these packages via `pip` you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Note, the above command won't install the optional matplotlib package. Matplotlib is used for creating plots, if you want plotting output than issue the following command to install matplotlib:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install matplotlib

If you want the exact version 20/20+ was tested on use the requirements_dev.txt file and python 2.7. The `probabilistic2020 <https://github.com/KarchinLab/probabilistic2020>`_ python package is used to generate features used by 20/20+ from the mutations in MAF format.

Check your PATH variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that you have add the 20/20+ directory to your `PATH` variable. If you have done this correctly, the following command should print the location of the 2020plus.py script.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ which 2020plus.py
